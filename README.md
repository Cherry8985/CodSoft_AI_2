AI TASK 2

TIC-TAC-TOE AI

Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe
against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with
or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable.
This project will help you understand game theory and basic search

algorithms.


 we've successfully implemented an AI agent capable of playing Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. By employing algorithms like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning, we've created an AI player that aims to make optimal moves and ensure an unbeatable performance.

This project has provided valuable insights into game theory and basic search algorithms. We've learned how to represent the game state, generate possible moves, evaluate the game tree, and select the best move for the AI player. Additionally, we've explored optimization techniques like Alpha-Beta Pruning to improve the efficiency of the search algorithm, enabling faster decision-making without sacrificing accuracy.
